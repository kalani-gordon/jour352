            <p>The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle
                and
                affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is a working dog, and registration is subject to
                successful
                completion of a working trial.[2] It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently
                registered
                breeds in
                several Western countries; some may compete in dog shows or obedience trials, or work as a guide dog.
            </p>

            <p>The Golden Retriever was bred by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late
                nineteenth
                century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of
                Red
                Setter,
                Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. It was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar
                period
                spread to many parts of the world.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>The Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks
                (later to
                become
                Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some
                other
                British
                dog breeds.[3][4] Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had been
                meticulously
                maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of the
                breed.[3][4][5] </p>
            <img src="img/goldenretriever-02.jpg" alt="Golden Retriever">

            <p>In the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his
                Scottish
                estate Guisachan.[3][6] He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called
                Nous;[note 1]
                Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all black-coloured
                litter.[3][5]
                Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred Flat-coated Retriever
                pups
                are
                whelped to matings of two black parents.[4][7] It is the pedigree of Nous that was the source for the
                romantic
                tales
                of the heritage of the Golden Retriever.[3] One early account claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian
                circus
                trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy.[3]
                The
                stud
                book
                states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near
                Brighton.[6][7][8]</p>

            <p>One early twentieth century enthusiast of the breed, Winifred Charlesworth, was instrumental in the
                establishment
                of
                the breed club as well as its separate Kennel Club recognition.[7] It was she who drew up the first
                breed
                standard,
                which was adopted by the Kennel Club and with only minor amendments and remains largely unchanged.[7]
                She
                bred
                and
                exhibited the first Golden Retriever Show Champion, was a strong advocate for maintaining the working
                instincts
                of
                the breed, and she is credited with popularising it at field trials and introducing it to shooting
                sportsmen.[note
                3][7]</p>

            <p>In the years after the First World War its popularity increased markedly and in the 1920s and 1930s it
                spread
                through
                much of the Western world.[7] The Canadian Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1927, the American Kennel
                Club in
                1932; the first examples were registered in France in 1934 and Australia in 1937.[3] The worldwide
                popularity of
                the
                breed meant it did not suffer the misfortunes many British dog breeds did during the Second World War
                due to
                British
                wartime restrictions on the breeding of larger dogs, with ample quality breeding stock available
                globally to
                ensure
                none of its characteristics were lost.[7]</p>

            <p>Since the 1940s its popularity has continued to grow, and it has become one of the most recognised and
                most
                frequently registered dog breeds in the Western world.[3]</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>The Golden Retriever is a powerfully built, medium-sized breed of dog; according to the Kennel Club breed
                standard,
                dogs stand from 56 to 61 centimetres (22 to 24 in) and bitches from 51 to 56 centimetres (20 to 22
                in).[7][10]
                Healthy adult examples typically weigh between 25 and 34 kilograms (55 and 75 lb).[11]</p>
            <p>The Golden Retriever has a broad head with a well-defined stop, with dark eyes set well apart, a wide and
                powerful
                muzzle, a large black nose, dark-pigmented and slightly drooping flews, and ears of moderate size set
                high
                and
                hanging with a slight fold.[11][12] The neck is muscular and fairly long with loose-fitting skin, the
                shoulders
                well
                laid-back and long-bladed, and the body deep through the chest with well-sprung ribs.[7][11][12] The
                back is
                usually
                level from withers to croup and the long, straight tail is usually carried flat, roughly in line with
                the
                back.[7][11][12] The forelegs are straight with good bone, the hind legs are powerful with well bent
                stifles
                and
                muscular thighs, and the feet are cat-like.[7][11][12]</p>
            <p>The double coat is a recognisable and striking feature:[9] the outer coat is long, flat or wavy and has
                good
                feathering on the forelegs, while the undercoat is dense and provides weather resistance.[11][12] The
                coat
                can
                be
                any shade of cream, yellow or gold; the coat typically becomes paler with age.[11][12] The Kennel Club
                breed
                standard prohibits red or mahogany-coloured coats, but a few white hairs on the chest are permitted.[10]
                Originally
                only yellow or golden coloured examples were permitted, this excluded many outstanding cream coloured
                dogs;
                to
                overcome this in 1936 the Kennel Club's standard was amended to include the cream colour.[7] The cream
                colour,
                which
                in more modern times can be almost white, has become the dominant colour and is particularly favoured by
                conformation show exhibitors.[13] Golden Retrievers that are bred for conformation shows tend to have
                longer
                and
                finer coats than those bred for working as gundogs.[13]</p>
            <img src="img/goldenretriever-04.jpg" alt="Golden Retriever">
            <p>The Kennel Club breed standard is accepted by every kennel club in the world except those of Canada and
                the
                United
                States.[7] Breed standards in North America call for a slightly taller dog[note 4] and the cream colour
                is
                not
                permitted.[7]</p>

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>The Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured and very affectionate breed of
                dog.[4][9]
                As is
                typical with retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and biddable, being very easy to train and
                extremely
                keen
                to please their master.[7][9] The breed is known to make excellent pets and family dogs, being generally
                extremely
                tolerant of children and keen to accompany any member of the family in a range of activities.[5] Due to
                their
                affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid of guarding instincts.[5] However, there have also
                been
                reports of some very aggressive Golden Retrievers in certain lineages. It has been suggested that these
                variations
                in aggression are partially caused by genetic factors.[15]</p>
            <p>The breed usually retains many of their gundog traits and instincts including an excellent sense of
                smell
                and a
                strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as gundogs it is typical for Golden Retrievers
                to
                present
                their owners with toys or other objects.[7][9] Compared to other retriever breeds the Golden Retriever
                is
                typically
                quite slow to mature.[9][13]</p>
