            <h1>Huevos Rancheros</h1>
            <p>Runny, fried eggs over a bed of seasoned beans, atop a layer of warm corn tortillas, add a few condiments
                and
                voilà! Homemade huevos rancheros!</p>
            <p>This Mexican breakfast recipe is just about as easy as it is delicious. As with our Breakfast Tacos, if
                you
                can
                open a can of beans and fry up an egg, you can make this simple recipe. You can use store-bought salsa
                to
                make
                life easy, or go the extra mile and whip up some Homemade Salsa. You can also make Black Beans from
                scratch!

            <ul>
                <li>Black beans</li>

                <li>Corn tortillas</li>
                <li>Perfectly fried eggs</li>
                <li>Cotija cheese—this salty, crumbly cow’s milk cheese is make-or-break for these huevos, so don’t skip
                    it!</li>
                <li>Cilantro</li>
                <li>Avocado</li>
                <li>Hot sauce</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fry up some eggs in a medium skillet. We like them sunny side up, but over easy is fine too—whatever
                    you
                    prefer!</li>
                <li>Simmer the black beans in the salsa.</li>
                <li>Warm the tortillas in a separate skillet or comal.</li>
                <li>Assemble! Tortilla, beans, egg.</li>
                <li>Garnish as you please! We love to go all out and top them with more salsa, avocado, cotija cheese,
                    cilantro
                    and hot sauce.
                </li>

            <h2>How to Store Leftovers + Tips</h2>
            <p><b>Leftovers</b> of the beans and salsa can be stored for 3-4 days or frozen for 3 months. Likewise,
                tortillas
                can be
                frozen (almost indefinitely!) for future use. When you’re ready to reheat, freshly fry as many eggs as
                you
                require and top to your heart’s desire.</p>
            <p><b>Don’t skimp on the toppings.</b> This Mexican huevos rancheros recipe is all about loading up on
                cheese
                and
                avocado
                and lots of hot sauce.</p>
            <p><b>If you like a fried egg with crispy edges</b>, heat olive oil in a skillet on high heat (you don’t
                want it
                to
                smoke)
                and crack your eggs. Once the edges have crisped up, reduce the heat and cook the yolks to your
                preference.
